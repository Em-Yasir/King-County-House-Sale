# King-County-House-Sale
This data is imported from an online resource. it is basically a house selling data in king county, Washington. We have developed a dashboard based on that data. We have an interactive calendar widget as our main filter and multiple visuals including a line chart, histograms, a map, and a heatmap. 
1- The line chart shows us the daily average of house sales prices in that county. 
2- We have created a map of that county where we can see different labels that can help us understand the house selling system there. 
3- We have some histograms that shows different distributions of overall House Prices,Bedrooms and Bathrooms.
4- Then we created a heatmap that shows the comparisons between the view of the area and the condition of the houses. 
5- Also we have created a cool interactive calender widget, in which you can check all the data according to the day/month/year.
